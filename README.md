DvCo is a Java-based desktop application developed in Eclipse with integrated MySQL database via phpMyAdmin. It is designed to manage a simple donut ordering system with 2 main functionalities, such as:
1. User Side:
- Browse & Order Donuts – View available donuts from the database.
- Add to Cart & Checkout – Cart and order details are stored and processed in the database.
2. Admin Side:
- Inventory Management – View product availability directly from the database.
- Insert New Products – Add new donut entries to the MySQL database.
- Update Existing Products – Edit donut details (price, stock, etc.) in real-time.
- Delete Products – Remove products from the database.

To create the desktop application in DvCo, we used the tools such as:
1. Frontend: Java (Eclipse)
2. Database: MySQL that managed with phpMyAdmin
3. Integration: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
4. Concepts: CRUD operations, OOP, Database normalization
